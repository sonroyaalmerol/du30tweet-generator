# What is this?
This is an attempt to generate tweets based on a dataset made out of existing tweets with the "du30" 2019 search query.

# Why?
Basically, to learn about natural language processing, and for fun.

# How?
I obtained the tweets to train the model from the search results of the query "du30" on Twitter using a python twitter scraper.

After obtaining, I just simply cleaned the dataset and trained the machine using the LSTM neural network.
